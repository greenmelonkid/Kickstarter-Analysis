# Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview: 

The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise determine if there was a relation between
different campaigns' launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges: 

I performed my analysis by using formulas to help me display the data in charts and graphs.
I could tell a few times that I was using the wrong formula, so it helped to play around with it.

## Results

<ADD CHART HERE>

From the theater outcomes by launch date chart, we can see that very few campaigns
were cancelled. We can also see that the majorite of the campaigns were successful
throughout the year, especially in the summer months.

<ADD GOALS CHART HERE>

There aren't a whole lot of things this chart helps us to understand. We can see that the
cancelled percentage is 0% across the board. The percentage successful and percentage failed, both 
fluctuate significantly as the goal becomes higher.

Some limitations of this dataset might be that we don't know why some of these
campaigns were successful or not. It could be a money issue, it could be a time issue, 
maybe the story just isn't very good. There are a lot of factors that the dataset
doesn't show us.

Maybe in the future, we could see if there was a correlation between money donated, or
how many donors and whether or not the campaign was successful.
